# MyJavaScriptLearning
Although this is about 2 months late, this is how I learnt JavaScript. I learnt through a Udemy course.
Feel free to look at some examples of concepts and feel free to look at my summary.txt and react_prerequisites.txt. 
After learning some JavaScript concepts, I watched Dave Gray's 9 hour tutorial on React. Here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVFAyFWO4go&t=27624s and here is his github for the tutorial: https://github.com/gitdagray/react_resources.
